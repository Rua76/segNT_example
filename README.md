# segNT sample run code
This is a sample code to show how to load and use pretrained gpn model to generate prediction on input sequence, and how to extract embeddings

It assume you are working on midway3 with gpu. Other running config can be changed in the ***submit.sbatch*** file
## 0. create a new working environment for gpn with mamba
```
mamba create -n gpn_test python=3.8
mamba activate gpn_test
```
## 1. install gpn on your working environment with pip
```
pip install git+https://github.com/songlab-cal/gpn.git
```
## 2. clone this repo to your working directory
```
git clone https://github.com/Rua76/gpn_sample
cd gpn_sample
```
## 3. install *git-lfs* and clone pretrained gpn model from huggingface
suppose you are using mamba
```
mamba install git-lfs
git clone https://huggingface.co/songlab/gpn-brassicales
```
## 4. run the script with sbatch
```
sbatch submit.sbatch
```
The print-out from this file will be stored in output file *log*
